# Masterclass follow-up
# This is the follow-up for today's (08.01.2020) masterclass on Multi-Class Image Classification.

This repository is divided into 2 parts:
  1. Source Code
  2. The presentation [Python AI Masterclass](Python_AI_Masterclass.pptx)
  
 ## Source Code
 The given project source codes are written in the easiest way so that most of the audience can digest it and it is 
 strongly advised not to use these configurations on production servers for any type of prediction problems.
  * [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) use this file to install all the required packages to proceed further
  * [config.py](config.py) is for storing all the configuration parameters and options needed for training and 
  running of the model
  * [model.py](model.py) is for generating CNN ClassificationNet model
  * [train.py](train.py) is for training ready model
  * [run.py](run.py) is for running trained models
  * [v_data](v_data) where all the dataset is stored
  * [classification_model_accs.png](classification_model_accs.png) the last history plot visualization for accuracy 
  checking from all of the epochs
  * [classification_model_losses.png](classification_model_losses.png) the last history plot visualization for loss 
  checking from all of the epochs
  

## Presentation
Presentation is more theoretical to explain the gap between Artificial Intelligence and 
Multi-Class Image Classification Problem. Also there are definitions for some crucial components
that play important role in building custom Neural Networks.
